# QRCode_Design_System
This backend project will form the core of the e-coupon system, handling user management, vendor management, QR code processing, coupon payments, and balance management. By implementing these functionalities, the backend will support the frontend user interface and provide a seamless experience for users and vendors.


In this project, Here are the key functions:

1.User Registration and Login: Implement the functionality for user registration, login, and authentication. This allows users to create accounts, securely log in, and access their personalized features. User authentication is essential for ensuring secure transactions and protecting user data.

2.Vendor Registration and Login: Implement the separate registration and login functionality for vendors. Vendors should have their own accounts and authentication system to access their specific features, such as checking their current balance.

3.QR Code Scanning and Data Processing: Build the functionality to scan QR codes and extract the encoded data. This involves implementing QR code scanning capabilities and processing the data contained within the QR code to retrieve transaction details.

4.Payment Processing and Transaction Management: Develop the logic for processing payments and managing transactions. This includes integrating with the private network's payment system and ensuring secure and accurate handling of transactions.

5.User Interface and Frontend Integration: Build the frontend interface that allows users to interact with the e-coupon system. Connect the frontend to the backend APIs to enable seamless communication and data exchange between the user interface and the backend functionalities.

6.Vendor Balance Management: Implement the functionality to track and manage vendor balances. This involves keeping records of the financial transactions associated with each vendor, updating the vendor's balance accordingly, and providing a way for vendors to check their current balance.
